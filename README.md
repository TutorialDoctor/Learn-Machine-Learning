# Learn-Machine-Learning

My adventures in learning machine learning

**Machine learning** - Subfield of AI. 

- AlphaGo

Machine Learning is where computers can learn from examples and experience


**Classifier** - function. takes data as input and asigns label as output. Classify email as spam or not spam. Classify image as apple or orange

**Supervised learning** - Create a classifier by finding patterns in examples

**Steps:**

1. Collect training data
2. Train Classifier
3. Make Predictions


**Feature** - input to the classifier

**Label** - output we want

**Decisions tree**

**Classifier** - box of rules. many types. input and output always same.

If classifier is a box of rules. A Learning  Algorithm is the procedure that creates the rules by finding patterns in the training data. It may notice orange weighs more, so it creates a rule that the heavier the fruit, the more likely it is to be an apple.

Choosing good features is one of your most important jobs.
